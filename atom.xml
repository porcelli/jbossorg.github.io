        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Case management provides problem resolution for dynamic processes as opposed to the efficiency-oriented approach of BPM for routine, predictable tasks. It manages one-off situations when the process flow is determined based on the incoming request. Red Hat Process Automation Manager provides the ability to define Case Management applications using the BPMN 2.0 notation. In this article, we will explore how you can capture audit metrics for a running case instance.  Using Case Listeners for fine-grained and async auditing  Case Events Listener can be used to capture notifications for case-related events and operations that are invoked on a case instance. This can then be sent downstream to analytical tools. The Case Events listener can be implemented by overriding any of the methods as defined by the interface.   In our example, we will set up a listener to capture the following events:   * Case start,  * Case close,  * Comments added and  * Case data added.  We will then send them over to a Kafka topic from which this data can be visualized or analyzed.  private void pushToKafka(CaseDefinition caseDefinition) {         try {             Future<RecordMetadata> out = producer.send(new ProducerRecord<String,                     String>("case_events", caseDefinition.getCaseId(), new ObjectMapper().writeValueAsString(caseDefinition)));          } catch (JsonProcessingException e) {             e.printStackTrace();         }     }      @Override     public void afterCaseStarted(CaseStartEvent event) {          CaseDefinition caseDefinition = new CaseDefinition(event.getCaseId(),"Case Started",null,null, new Date());         pushToKafka(caseDefinition);     }      @Override     public void finalize() {         System.out.println("case listener clean up");             producer.flush();              producer.close();      }      @Override     public void afterCaseDataAdded(CaseDataEvent event) {          CaseDefinition caseDefinition = new CaseDefinition(event.getCaseId(),"Case Data Added",event.getData(),null, new Date());         pushToKafka(caseDefinition);     };      @Override     public void afterCaseDataRemoved(CaseDataEvent event) {         CaseDefinition caseDefinition = new CaseDefinition(event.getCaseId(),"Case Data Removed",event.getData(),null, new Date());         pushToKafka(caseDefinition);     };      @Override     public void afterCaseClosed(CaseCloseEvent event) {         CaseDefinition caseDefinition = new CaseDefinition(event.getCaseId(),"Case Closed",null,null, new Date());         pushToKafka(caseDefinition);     };      @Override     public void afterCaseCommentAdded(CaseCommentEvent event) {         CaseComment caseComment = new CaseComment(event.getComment().getComment(),event.getComment().getAuthor());         CaseDefinition caseDefinition = new CaseDefinition(event.getCaseId(),"Comments Added",null,caseComment,new Date());         pushToKafka(caseDefinition);     };      @Override     public void afterCaseReopen(CaseReopenEvent event) {         CaseDefinition caseDefinition = new CaseDefinition(event.getCaseId(),"Case Reopened",null,null, new Date());         pushToKafka(caseDefinition);     }   Notice how we extract the event data properties that we are interested in so that we can push it for analysis. We will then package the listener class as a maven project so that we can configure it on our case project. A complete example of the listener can be found in this .  Configuring the listener on the case project:  Now that we have created the listener, we will now configure it in our case project.  First, we should add the listener jar to business central so that our case project can use it. You can use Business Central UI to upload the jar file. The following Aritfact upload option can be acessed through the menu Central  → Settings →Artifacts. Upload the jar file:  Now, let’s add the dependency for the listener jar on our case project. You can do this by accessing, Business Central in Menu → Design → PROJECT_NAME → Settings →Dependencies  Next, you can configure the listener using the deployment descriptors. Access it in: Business Central in Menu → Design → PROJECT_NAME → Settings → Deployments.  Finally, we can build and deploy the changes, and the listener should be able to capture case changes as they occur.  Visualizing the collected data  In order to visualize the data, let us set up a simple UI application. This reads from the kafka topic where we push our case metrics and shows it on a responsive UI. The application can be started using:   mvn quarkus:dev  The UI application should be available at  Testing the Case Audit Metrics:  Let us create a case request.  We can now see that audit metrics start populating on the UI application we created.  Notice how the case start and case data added events have been captured. For every data element added to the case file, the event defines the payload associated with the data added.  Similarly, other case changes like comments being added and cases being closed can be captured similarly.  Summary  This simple demo project for case listeners and the UI can be used with any case project. It shows how we can set up a listener for a case, and how we could push it down to Kafka for effective monitoring and audit traceability.  References:    The post appeared first on .  ]]></content>

        <link href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/11/deadline-notifications-after-restart.html"/>
        <updated>2021-11-16T16:53:42.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[“Deadlines keep you on track for success” (Timothy Dalton)   MOTIVATION: SHOULDN’T WE AUTOMATE RESILIENCE TESTING AS WELL?  This article follows the . In this ocasion, we will cover how to test deadline notifications after KIE server restart.  With human task deadlines, you can set a time limit for that task, when not started or completed. Therefore, the KIE server will send a notification (by default, an automated email) to the target people defined for that task as managers, administrators, other team members.  Here, we will focus on resilience testing. If the KIE server crashes, as there is a mechanism to persist the timer in a database, the KIE server will recover it after restarting. Consequently, the failover mechanism allows sending the deadline notification (triggered before crashing) at the right timing.  The following figure depicts this scenario:  This flow involves multiple system testing components: KIE Server, database, and SMTP server for mailing. We might be tempted to do a one-time setup instead of creating an automated test for our CI/CD pipelines.  But, in the spirit of Martin Fowler’s soundbite (reduces pain drastically), we will follow the automated approach. This way we will exercise the failover scenario regularly, taking advantage of containers.   First of all, we have to select our tools wisely, as the SMTP server.   ONE SMTP SERVER TO TRACK THEM ALL  The purpose of notification testing is to ensure that:   * right inbox receives the expected emails (no more, no less).  * the received emails have the right content for headers and body.  So, we need a containerized SMTP server with the following requirements:   * Easy to configure: minimum setup for required operations (e.g.,    authentication is useless to check testing emails)  * Fast bootstrap: not too long to be up and running  * Clear API to assist test automation: documented REST APIs to retrieve and    clear emails.  In our case, we have chosen “”, an open-source SMTP server, as it fulfills these expectations and also has a docker image published in .  We use the following REST APIs in our automation. Respectively, they retrieve all the messages from the inbox and delete all the messages after each test:  Notice that they belong to different versions of the API (there is no DELETE operation at v2). Therefore, two different basePaths (/api/v2, /api/v1) will be set up for each endpoint in the REST-assured RequestSpecification.   FITTING CONTAINERS TOGETHER  Once we have defined our testing approach with self-unit independent pieces (containers) and the testing frameworks (Junit5 with and ), it is time to write our tests that will be the glue for fitting all the components together.   Our system-under-test -the main component- is the KIE Server. From version 7.61.0.Final, we can download it from the .  From a Multistage Dockerfile, a temporary image on-the-fly will be created containing the business application (kjar) for exercising test scenarios. Therefore:   * First stage, it will pull the slim maven image and install the kjars tailored    for our tests.  * Second stage, it will pull the KIE server image (in this case, ) with any    additional configuration (jboss-cli scripts for configuring persistence and    logging).  The mailhog container is a testcontainers GenericContainer (that internally pulls the latest image from docker hub). It is exposing their SMTP and HTTP ports. Notice that it shares the same network as the rest of the containers: communication can occur among them without the need of exposing ports through the host.  @Container public static GenericContainer<?> mailhog = new GenericContainer<>("mailhog/mailhog:latest")         .withExposedPorts(PORT_SMTP, PORT_HTTP)         .withNetwork(network)         .withNetworkAliases("mailhog")         .withLogConsumer(new Slf4jLogConsumer(logger))         .waitingFor(Wait.forHttp("/"));   Finally, the PostgreSQL container is one of the out-of-the-box testcontainers database modules. We will use the initialization script under /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d containing postgresql-jbpm-schema.sql as explained .  Maven build-tool pulls the schema from GitHub sources, from the same branch as the system-under-test. It is automatically downloaded using the download-maven-plugin at generate-sources phase, as it is shown in this snippet taken from the pom.xml:  <configuration>   <url>http://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiegroup/jbpm/${version.org.kie}/jbpm-db-scripts/src/main/resources/db/ddl-scripts/postgresql/postgresql-jbpm-schema.sql</url>   <outputFileName>postgresql-jbpm-schema.sql</outputFileName>   <unpack>false</unpack>   <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/postgresql</outputDirectory> </configuration>    TESTING DEADLINE NOTIFICATIONS AFTER KIE SERVER RESTART  This scenario (deadline notifications after KIE server restart) in former releases of KIE Server contained a bug tracked by :  duplicated emails were received in the target inboxes.  The root cause was that the initialization of the human task service occurred before the deployment (upon server restart). Therefore, the timer service was not available at the moment of starting deadlines, provoking the problem of double notification.  Let’s try to verify that, after fixing, it is working properly.  First of all, we need a kjar containing a simple process with a human task with this deadline configuration:  We can easily stop the KIE Server container after deploying the kjar and start it again to simulate a crash with a reboot.   And then, after deadlines timeout, we will check the expected outcome by means of REST-assured utils. We can connect to Mailhog to assure that the received emails match the expected ones:  given()      .spec(specV2)      .when()      .get("/messages")      .then()      .body("total", equalTo(3))      .assertThat().body("items[0].Content.Headers.To", hasItem("administrator@jbpm.org"))      .assertThat().body("items[0].Content.Headers.From", hasItem("john@jbpm.org"))      .assertThat().body("items[0].Content.Headers.Subject", hasItem("foo"))      .assertThat().body("items[0].Content.Body", is("bar"));  We also have another test for checking the case when a different kjar is deployed after the KIE server restart, then, no notification is sent because the kjar that triggered the deadline is not deployed again.  Finally, you can find the code and configuration for this example .   CONCLUSION: AUTOMATED TESTS FOR DEADLINE NOTIFICATIONS AFTER KIE SERVER RESTART  Automated Tests are also a good option to make resilience and integration testing less painful.  We can combine different dockerized components (from the system-under-test -KIE server- to external databases -PostgreSQL- or SMTP servers -Mailhog-) into JUnit tests. As we control the containers’ lifecycle, it is easy to stop/start them to check failover mechanisms.  The post appeared first on .  ]]></content>

Each was a one day event,  part of a new series of small-scale events, that brings the discussion of open source technology to your local cities.  The days were intended to bring updates and insights into the latest technologies and also offered the opportunity to get hands on with a few Red Hat technologies.  There were different streams of session topics hosting tech talks led by Red Hat experts and also business focused sessions delivered from local industry leaders including some fantastic partner and customer stories.  I was invited to give a session at both events in Dublin this week and wanted to share the slides presented that included links to all of the available content we discussed.   As a refresh on the day, we shared our insights into our larger architectures exploring how open source can be used successfully at scale. Below you will find the slides:      Provided here as a reminder, the title and abstract:          You've heard of large scale open source architectures, but have you ever wanted to take a serious look at these real life enterprise implementations that scale? This session takes attendees on a tour of multiple use cases covering enterprise challenges like integration, optimisation, cloud adoption, hybrid cloud management, and much more. Not only are these architectures interesting, but they are successful real life implementations featuring open source technologies and power many of your own online experiences.     The attendee departs this session with a working knowledge of how to map general open source technologies to their solutions. Material covered is available freely online and attendees can use these solutions as starting points for aligning to their own solution architectures. Join us for an hour of power as we talk architecture shop!   Hope you enjoyed the session and if you were not able to attend, maybe we can meet and chat about this in person someday in the near future.  ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[In the we showed how to use our fancy new Public API, but I threatened promised you we would get back to the design rationale. So, here we are. This blog post is rather long, so I decided to break down into two parts. It is loosely based on the presentation I gave during , but I am adding some details about DataContexts that I did not include during that live stream.    However, if you would rather sit though me blabbering about API design, please . Otherwise read on.       SEVEN RED LINES      A long, long time ago, Tiago Dolphine and I were tasked with the goal of designing a public API for our platform. The requirements were easy enough; the API should have been:       * consistent across all components  * extensible with new components while retaining consistency  * flexible in the way components can define their own methods, because no    component is totally equal to the others      My immediate reaction was along the lines of:            I don’t know how familiar you are with that video where the expert in red-line-drawing pictured above is being asked to draw . But that is kind of like how the requirements above felt at first: that is, very contrasting with each other.      Moreover, ourselves, we wanted to go further and design something that scaled and allowed for multiple types of interactions.      In fact, KIE 7 APIs are designed for a synchronous, Java-based, local workflow.      We wanted the new design to scale even in an asynchronous, , setting. But in order do that, the API surface should have been minimal and account for communication over the wire.       AN EMERGING DESIGN      As we recovered from our confusion, we decided that the best strategy to deal with this was to first observe whatever we did so far, and look for patterns. Then evolve those patterns to account for the new use cases that we had in mind.  After all, the code-generation procedure that in Kogito automatically materializes REST endpoints from business assets uses an internal Java API that evolved from our internal requirements.      This API was not completely designed, rather for a large part it just evolved from emerging requirements. The reason why we never called it public is that we wanted to take our time to make it cohesive and consistent.      That time had finally come.          We started by observing how REST endpoints created and interacted with sessions, process instances, DMN models, PMML models.      // Processes application.     .get(Processes.class)     .processById(processId) .createInstance(...) .start()  // Rule Units application.     .get(RuleUnits.class)     .create(Class<?>) .createInstance(...) .fire()  // PMML application.     .get(PredictionModels.class)     .getPredictionModel(modelName) .evaluateAll(...) ...  // DMN application.     .get(DecisionModels.class)     .getDecisionModel(modelName) .evaluateAll(...) ...       As you can see, all these API look different, but not wildly different. So a common pattern was emerging. In general we can see how the API is concerned with getting to a named resource, and then invoking a method over it.      app.get(ModelType.class)    .getResourceById($identifier)    .action(values)       In some cases, before you get to invoke the action() you may need to navigate further to a sub-component within that resource, e.g.:      app.get(ModelType.class)    .getResourceById($identifier)    .instances()    .getInstanceId($instance_id)    .action(values)       or:      app.get(ModelType.class)    .getResourceById($identifier)    .subComponent()    .getSubComponentId($instance_id)    .action(values)       for instance:      application.     .get(Processes.class)     .processById(processId)     .getInstance(instanceId)     .getWorkItem(name)     .update(values)      The method is usually is a “verb” indicating an action to apply over the resource, with a payload that represents the data context over which the action should be applied   OBSERVATIONS      All these method calls have something in common. The breakthrough came when we came to the following 3 realizations:   1. The fluent API denotes a path  2. “Verbs” are always at the end of the method chain  3. Each method is applied to at most one “payload”  Let’s see them in detail.   OBSERVATION 1: THE FLUENT API DENOTES A PATH      Imagine that we want to invoke a method (a “command”) over a process, or a process instance; or over a decision model, or over a prediction model; or over a rule unit. In order to identify these resources, we always have to pass an identifier.      The identifier is constructed differently for each type of resource, and usually it is not self-contained; i.e. by the identifier alone, it is hard to predict what kind of resource it would point to; for instance, is my.resource the name of a process? Is it the name of a PMML? A DMN maybe?      If you were sent this single string over the wire, how would you decode it? Well, you could create a structured object, instead:      class ProcessInstanceId {   ProcessId parentProcess;   String instanceName; } class ProcessId {   String processName; }      But then, would you represent the type of the object? How would normalize and serialize this into a String? How can you make sure that this String is representable as an object not just in Java, but making sure that is consumable by a client, written, say, in Python?      And here comes the first observation. Consider, for instance:      app.get(Processes.class)    .get($process_id)    .instances()    .get($instance_id)  /processes/$process_id/instances/$instance_id      This method invocation returns an object of type Process<?> over which you will invoke a command, for instance start(variables). Each method call may fail, because $process_id may not exist, it may not have child instances, or the instance $instance_id does not belong to that process.  This eager evaluation of the method chain makes it hard to design an asynchronous API around it. In a trivial remote implementation, each method invocation would correspond to a remote call.  However, if we look at the method chain, we notice that each invocation does not really perform an action, but rather retrieves an object, that retrieves another object, that retrieves yet another object… until the last item on the chain is reached, which is usually an action (a “verb”) like start() or evaluate().   This means that everything that comes before the action is really a path. And a Path is trivially serializable as a string:      /processes/$process_id/instances/$instance_id      > This is the reason we introduced the AppRoot object, which provides a fluent, > navigable, typed API to a resource, while still retaining the ability to > convert into a string, and parseable back into a typed object.   The validation of such a path can be delayed until the entire path has been formed, and delegated to the action itself. Which brings us to the second observation       OBSERVATION 2: “VERBS” ARE ALWAYS AT THE END OF THE METHOD CHAIN  If the fluent API denotes a Path, we can delay validation and defer it when a command is invoked, . For example, if we don’t check if a process instance identifier exists until we try to start() it, then the start() command may perform that check..      app.get(Processes.class)    .get($process_id)    .instances()    .get($instance_id)    .start()      In other words, “real” commands are always at the end of a chain of method calls; the method chain only serves the purpose of “finding” the right object instance. In fact, the relation between “commands” and the method chain that precedes them may become clearer if we rewrite it as follows:              abort(app.get(Processes.class)    .get($process_id)    .instances()    .get($instance_id))      or even:      ProcessInstance pi = app.get(Processes.class)    .get($process_id)    .instances()    .get($instance_id);  start(pi, variables)      This apparently small realization has a deep effect: it means that we can separate the definition of the commands from the way we address a process or a process instance.       * It means that we can identify commands by their name  * It also means that we may have multiple implementation of such commands  In other words, the following text conveys about the same amount of information as the method chain above:      START   /processes/$process_id/instances/$instance_id    variables      And this makes it representable using pretty much any programming language.  The text above can be seen as a simple specification of one of the “commands” that our system accepts. It includes information about   1. /processes the type of resource  2. /$process_id the identifier of that resource  3. /instances a type sub-component of that resource  4. /$instance_id the identifier of that sub-component   a collection of such rows       COMMAND        /TYPE/$MAIN_ID/$SUB-PATH        PAYLOAD   forms the description of a service. For instance a service for a DMN engine may be:      EVALUATE    /decisions/$decision_id   evaluation-context   It should be easy to see how this easily map to method calls, REST service requests, or even messages.   > In general, this is the reason why we introduced services; i.e., interfaces > that describe the entire API surface of an engine, and multiple interfaces and > implementations can be provided for the same engine (for instance a > synchronous vs an asynchronous process service).  For instance:  interface DecisionService {     DataContext evaluate(Id identifier, DataContext ctx);  }  but also, possibly:  interface AsyncDecisionService {     Future<DataContext> evaluate(Id identifier, DataContext ctx);  }  In the next part of this post we will see this principle more in detail.   OBSERVATION 3: EACH METHOD IS APPLIED TO AT MOST ONE PAYLOAD (AND POSSIBLY EXTRA METADATA)      Each method is generally applied to an object that sometimes is called a model or variables (processes), sometimes data (RuleUnitData, for rules), sometimes context (DMN and PMML). More generally that is the payload of the request    The object is generally used to extract values or to send values through a command.      application.     .get(Processes.class)     .processById(processId)     .getInstanceById(instanceId)     .updateVariables(model)      Now, a frequent pattern for the model object is to convert that object into another type. For instance, it is frequent to project variables of a project to show only “input” variables and “output” variables. In other cases, it may be useful to extract the computation results as a Map and then convert that Map to another type.  In any case, if we consider a distributed, polyglot execution environment, tying the representation of the data that is manipulated through an engine feels very restrictive.  > This is why we introduced the DataContext interface, shared across > implementations, and requiring the simple contract that a DataContext should > be convertible into another type of DataContext through some mapping > mechanism.       CONCLUSION      In this post, I gave an overview of the principles and reasoning that were put into the design of the new public API.  In the next post, I will show what these principles may enable in the future.  In particular we will see how using paths for identifiers makes it easier to adopt it in multiple situations (such as data binding), that in turn enables a lot of convenient use cases. We will also see how the simple service-based API definition scheme may be useful in the future to enable service discovery and distributed execution.         The post appeared first on .  ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Apache Camel is a project in constant transformation. Anyone knows that Camel has been able to adapt to any new kinds of protocols and systems that have emerged in the past 15 years. But it’s not only that: Camel is also able to adapt to any new ways of dealing with integration problems in the cloud era. While Camel K represented a fundamental shift towards a new approach to cloud-native integration, are driving a deeper transformation towards “low code” development.  When I talk about “low code”, I refer to a platform for developers where you can achieve most of your goals without writing any code. But at the same time, a low code platform should be customizable enough to let you show your development skills when it’s time to solve critical issues. It needs to be abstract in order to easily deal with the most common problems, even using a UI. But it should not prevent a developer to play with the low level details in order to extend the capabilities of the platform itself.  If you’re a bit familiar with how work, I think you’ve already got my point here.   BINDINGS AND KARAVANS  It’s really easy to use Kamelets, especially in combination with . I’ve shown in that moving data from Knative or Kafka into an S3 bucket using streaming upload is as simple as writing something like this:  apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1 kind: KameletBinding metadata:   name: events-to-s3 spec:   source:     ref:       apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1       kind: Channel       name: messages       # Or a Strimzi "KafkaTopic", if you prefer   sink:     ref:       kind: Kamelet       apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1       name: aws-s3-streaming-upload-sink     properties:       bucketNameOrArn: "my-bucket"       accessKey: "<your-key>"       # ...   (, )  You write this file, apply it to a Kubernetes cluster where Camel K is installed: done!  And it’s completely declarative. You just specify where you want to move data from and to: no need to care about lower level details.  If writing YAML is not your favourite sport, you can also opt for a visual UI. I’ve shown in the how the OpenShift dev console is already instructed to use Kamelets in combination with Knative. But there’s a new project in the horizon at Apache that will bring this model even further…  is a new project started at Apache by . It is a generic visual UI that can design integrations based on Kamelets. If you either need to create a simple source/sink integration or a more complex one, Karavan can help designing it with ease. There’s also a if you want to learn more.  The Karavan UI  After you finish to configure the integration, the output you get from the UI is an Integration custom resource, that you can direcly apply to any Kubernetes cluster (having Camel K installed) and it will automatically run.  We have now a wider available upstream and it will cover many use cases that you may have in mind. They are the building blocks for letting you connect systems without writing any code: just choose if you want to use the YAML configuration or let the Karavan UI create it for you.   WHERE’S MY KAMELET?  There’s no doubt you’ll find a use case which is not covered by a Kamelet. For example, what about moving data between parts of your organization?  In traditional Camel the approach you would have taken to address this problem is to create one or more ad hoc integrations to fullfill any of your needs. You’d develop a custom integration route for each use case you have in mind.  The Kamelet approach is completely different. You develop a reusable Kamelet that is responsible of taking specific data out of your system (a source), or putting some data back into your system (a sink). Once you’ve done that, you can treat it as a high level connector in the Karavan UI and use it, whenever you need, in multiple scenarios where you need to move data around, without having to code everything from scratch each time.  Writing a Kamelet is easy, much easier than writing a Camel component, if you’ve ever tried doing so. We’ve written an extended that covers both easy and complex scenarios.  We know that creating a source or a sink and also doing it right may be difficult (integration is hard, that’s why we have Apache Camel) and involve multiple enterprise integration patterns. The Kamelet developer guide contains a that is complicated on purpose, to mimic a Kamelet that may be developed for handling data inside an organization.  When writing a new Kamelet, you can use plain YAML to describe a route template, add Java (or Groovy, or …) code snippets if you need them, or also link an external Maven project in case you want to add a more complex behavior to it (we did it in the repository, where we build the default catalog of Kamelets).  What does not change is that, once a Kamelet is written, the logic inside it is well encapsulated and you can treat it as any other connector, in a Binding or in the Karavan UI.  A Kamelet is then the element that enables low code development: it’s easy to configure and embeddable in any UI (such as we’ve done in Karavan), and allows you to fully customize its behavior, even writing various degrees of custom code, up to the lowest level elements of a Camel integration route.   WHERE TO GO NEXT  Check out the , where you can build an run the Karavan designer. There’s also a that will let you design integrations directly from the IDE.  Then start playing with Karavan in combination with and the .  And finally look at how easy is to .  We’d love to hear your feedback!]]></content>

<p>This past week, the Wildfly Elytron team (a team specializing in server and client side security) participated in the <a href="https://ghc.anitab.org/programs-and-awards/open-source-day/">Open Source Day</a> hackathon.
It is an all day hackathon celebrating Open Source technologies and allowing participants to learn about Open Source and contribute to projects designed to solve real world problems.</p>
<p>Issues in the Elytron issue tracker were triaged ahead of the event and new contributors were onboarded and taught about Git, creating and submitting pull requests, and how Open Source works.
The event went well for the Elytron team with double the amount of PRs submitted than in the Summer Open Source Day!</p>
<p>We’d also like to mention that in Wildfly 25 support has been added for the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 2.0. More information and a sample application can be found within <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/10/14/MicroProfile-Reactive-Messaging-2.0-in-WildFly-25/">the announcement</a>.</p>

    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to yet another installment of the JBoss Editorial! September is coming to an end, but it has been a pretty busy month for the JBoss community.</p><p></p>

<h2 id="_quarkus">Quarkus</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Quarkus has really come a long way since the first release only a few years ago. A testament to the fact is certainly the compelling user stories released by the project’s team in the last weeks. First, we have <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/logicdrop-customer-story/">How Quarkus Improved Logicdrop’s Developer Experience and Process</a>, followed by <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/adoptium-customer-story/">Eclipse Adoptium Uses Quarkus for high volume Java SE distribution API</a>. And we even have a nice retail business use case, with <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/decathlon-user-story/">VCStream: a new messaging platform for DECATHLON’s Value Chain, built on Quarkus</a>!</p>
<p>So, if you have yet to jump onboard the Quarkus train, it’s really time to do so! And, to help you do it, you can check out this nice tutorial on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/09/20/quarkus-spring-developers-getting-started">Quarkus for Spring developers: Getting started</a>.

<div class="sectionbody">
<p>In the past months, we’ve been doing some hard work to ensure that JBoss software can fit as neatly as possible within an Ansible playbook. There is a still a lot to be done, but we are already quite proud of to two Ansible collections we have released. The first one is called, JCliff, but will soon be renamed to WildFly, as it aims to integrate, as smoothly as possible, the app server into Ansible. The latest version (v.0.0.10) has already a few exciting features:
* systemd integration, a reusable role to help set up WildFly as a systemd service
* a reusable role to install JDBC driver and their module
* and, of course, more fine-tuning of WildFly’s subsystem thanks to the JCLiff (embedded in the collection) which allows Ansible to configure mod_cluster, sockets, JMS queues and so many other features.</p>
<p>We are also very happy about the release of JWS Collection for Ansible (v0.0.2), which allows us to quickly set up Apache Tomcat or its counterpart, JBoss Web Server, but also provides some nice features, like integration with systemd and common criteria (partial) compliance checking. Please check our blog entry about this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/08/30/automate-red-hat-jboss-web-server-deployments-ansible">Ansible collection for Apache Tomcat / JWS</a> for more details!</p>
<p>(Given that those are projects I work on, I fully assume that this entry is a shameless plug :) )</p>

<p>The Kogito team do an amazing job providing hands-on, practical examples for real-world use cases.
Since our last editorial, Gabriele concludes a previous post by demonstrating how to set up a Kogito service that allows remote clients to get purchase recommendations to personalize a web shopping experience.</p>
<p>Mario Fusco’s latest entry on the Kogito blog gives a lot of food for thought and is highly recommended.
In his article, Mario digs into migrating from Drools and start using Kogito and Quarkus.
He shows you how to start building microservices that you can eventually deploy into Function as a Service (FaaS) environments to provide stateless rule evaluation.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 11 August 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>After short pause for the summer holiday, welcome back to this new installment of the JBoss Editorial! As always, the JBoss community has been quite active and there is quite a lot to cover today, especially on hybrid cloud and Kogito. Let’s dive right in!</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_hybrid_cloud">Hybrid Cloud</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>During the last weeks, Christina Lei did a quite interesting series of articles on hybrid cloud. After an <a href="https://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2021/08/overview-of-making-hybrid-multi-cloud.html">overview of making hybrid cloud</a>, she explores some in-depth topic like <a href="https://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2021/08/hybrid-multi-cloud-dynamic-security.html">dynamic security</a> or <a href="https://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2021/08/observability-in-hybrid-multi-cloud">observability</a>.

<p>With the new release of <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/kogito-1-9-1-released.html">Kogito 1.9.1</a>, it’s time to explore (maybe again) all the potential of this framework. And fortunately, there are a lot of in-depth articles released recently doing just that!

Or explore <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/event-driven-decisioning-with-amq-streams-and-kogito.html">event-driven decisinning with AMQ streams and Kogito</a>. If those articles have but open your appetite for the framework, you can carry on with a tutorial on <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/how-develop-better-widgets-with-showcase-appl.html">how to develop better widgets</a> or how to <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/08/add-data-from-kie-execution-server-for-authoring-dashboards.html">add data from KIE server for authoring dashboards</a>.</p>

In <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/28/making-java-programs-cloud-ready-part-2-upgrade-legacy-java-application-jakarta">part two</a> the application will move from Java 8 to Java 11, JBoss EAP 7.3 and Jakarta EE. Lastly, in <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/30/making-java-programs-cloud-ready-part-3-integrate-microprofile-services">part three</a> the application will be moved to microservices. Additional monitoring tools will be introduced including Prometheus and Jaeger. The application will be updated for handling restarts, health checks, and other configuration settings.</p>
<p>Over in the BPM arena, there are three posts to take a look at: <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/06/custom-logic-in-bpmn.html">Custom logic in BPMN</a> by Kirill Gaevksii, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/07/how-to-start-contributing-to-drools-executable-model.html">How to start contributing to Drools executable model</a> where Luca Molteni discusses getting your feet with contributing to Drools’s "Executable Model Compiler". Lastly, Matteo Mortari discusses <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/06/intelligent-kafka-message-routing-using-drools-dmn-engine-and-apache-camel.html">using Drools DMN and Apache Camel to intelligently route Kafka messages</a>. It includes a video as well as various examples and code to really sink your teeth into.</p>
<p>Wildfly 24.0.0.Final includes a preview of Jakarta EE 9.1 features. Jeff Mesnil discusses <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/07/01/wildfly-preview-bootable-jar/">how to try these features out using a bootable jar</a>. There’s also a section about getting up and running using OpenShift!</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Katia and Ryan on the Infinispan team released a nice two-part series of posts that explained how they built an online game across data centers and multiple cloud providers for this year’s Summit keynote demonstration.
In the first part, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/05/28/building-real-time-leaderboard-red-hat-data-grid-and-quarkus-hybrid-kubernetes">Building a real-time leaderboard with Infinispan and Quarkus on a hybrid Kubernetes deployment</a>, Katia and Ryan describe how they designed and implemented various services using Infinispan and Quarkus.
With part two, they explain how using the Infinispan Operator greatly reduced the complexity of standing up their clusters, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/08/create-and-manage-red-hat-data-grid-services-hybrid-cloud">Creating and managing Infinispan services in the hybrid cloud</a>.</p>
<p>Tommaso Teofili’s recent post, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/06/autotuning-lime-explanations-with-few-predictions.html">Autotuning LIME explanations with few predictions</a>, outlines how to automatically tune LIME hyperparameters to achieve more stable explanations and comes with a PR that lets you dig into all the technical aspects covered in the post.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/06/rhpam-connectivity-to-external-amq-configurations-in-openshift.html">RHPAM connectivity to external AMQ configurations in OpenShift</a> by Michael Perez takes an in-depth look at connecting to an external AMQ with the aim of lowering the memory footprint for RHPAM pods as well as other deployment optimizations.
It’s an interesting read with good technical considerations to sink your teeth into so go give it a look.</p>
<p>Over on the WildFly blog, Jeff Mesnil walks us through the process of changing logging levels for cloud-based WildFly applications on the fly.
Take a look at Jeff’s script and straightforward commands to help you easily modify logs for debugging in his post, <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/06/15/change-log-level-wildfly-cloud/">How to Change Logging Level for WildFly on the Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>Bilgin Ibryam is back with a post on the Red Hat Developer blog titled <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/14/application-modernization-patterns-apache-kafka-debezium-and-kubernetes">Application modernization patterns with Apache Kafka, Debezium, and Kubernetes</a>.
I really enjoyed this one as Bilgin expertly puts application modernization in context and examines different patterns, tools, and open-source ecosystems that can help you migrate brown-field systems to more modern, event-driven services as well as design green-field services that are future proof by providing the ability to evolve over time.
Be sure to catch up on this one if you haven’t already read it.</p>
<p>Just in time for your summer reading list the first book dedicated to Keycloak has been published, <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2021/06/book.adoc">Keycloak - Identity and Access Management for Modern Applications</a>.
Congrats to authors Stian Thorgersen and Pedro Igor Silva.
It’s an impressive achievement and no doubt the book is full of invaluable expertise.</p>

<p>In our last editorial we mentioned Eric Schabell’s series on a retail data framework.
Since then Eric has obviously been hard at work as his next two posts in the series, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/05/retail-data-framework-common-architectural-elements.html">Retail data framework - Common architectural elements</a> and <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/06/retail-data-framework-example-data-architecture.html">Retail data framework - Example data architecture</a>.
If you haven’t caught up on that series yet, then I highly recommend taking a look to learn about data flows and management in a retail context.</p>
<p>Eric has also posted the first in his next series, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/05/cloud-adoption-an-architectural-introduction.html">Cloud adoption - An architectural introduction</a>.
This series is focused on proven integrations, structures, and interactions with the goal of enabling readers to implement and adopt cloud-based solutions using open-source technologies.
I’m really excited about this series and can’t wait to see what Eric brings in his next posts.</p>

<p>Jeff Mesnil has authored a very helpful and detailed look at building and deploying WildFly applications on OpenShift using Helm Charts in his post, <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/05/05/helm-charts-for-wildfly/">Helm Chart for WildFly</a></p>
<p>Over on the Infinispan blog, Ryan Emerson has shared some details about the CLI compiled to a native image in <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2021/05/21/infinispan-cli-image">Infinispan Native CLI</a>, which is well worth a read.
You should also try downloading the latest Infinispan 12 server version and taking it for a spin with the native CLI!</p>
<p>Another recent one from the Infinispan team comes from Katia Aresti who, along with Ryan Emerson, explains how they <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/05/28/building-real-time-leaderboard-red-hat-data-grid-and-quarkus-hybrid-kubernetes">built a real-time leaderboard using Data Grid and several Quarkus extensions</a> to add some magic to this year’s Red Hat Summit Keynote.</p>

<p>Have you been wanting to find out more about Shenandoah GC?

<p>Eric Schabell never disappoints and his previous series on architectural elements in a real-time stock control solution for retail was no exception.
Eric rounds that series off nicely with <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/05/real-time-stock-control-example-stock-control-architecture.html">Real-time stock control - Example stock control architecture</a>.</p>
<p>Not one to rest for long, Eric Schabell launches a new series that tackles how to create a framework for accessing retail data from customers, stock, stores, and staff across multiple internal teams.
I’m sure it’s going to be a brilliant series so go have a look for yourself and find out more in his post, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/05/retail-data-framework-architectural-introduction.html">Retail data framework - An architectural introduction</a>.</p>
<p>I also really enjoyed reading through Christina and Eric’s <a href="http://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2021/05/tooling-guide-for-getting-started-with.html">Tooling guide for Getting Started with Apache Camel in 2021</a>.

    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another - slightly delayed, installment of our JBoss Editorial! If anything, the last two weeks in the Jboss community has been all about Quarkus and Kogito. Indeed, you’ll find in this post a trove of information and news on the two projects. But also, an exciting opportunity on Keycloak! Without any further ado, let’s jump right in.</p><p></p>

<p>With the Red Hat Summit coming up tomorrow, you may want to check out this post of our very own Eric D. Schabell on the new format we are trying out this year: <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/red-hat-summit-2021-how-to-enjoy-this-three-part-event-series.html">Red Hat Summit: How to enjoy this three-part event series</a>.</p>
<p>On top of that, Eric has, as always, delivered a steady stream of content in the past weeks, with a focus on headless architecture. It started with a first post on <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/headless-ecommerce-an-architectural-introduction.html">Headless eCommerce - An architectural introduction</a>, to which he did a followup on: <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/headless-ecommerce-common-architectural-elements.html">Headless eCommerce - Common architectural elements</a>.</p>
<p>Headless architecture was also part of the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/store-health-and-safety-architectural-introduction.html">Store health and safety architectural introduction</a>, which also was followed up by a post on <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/store-health-and-safety-common-architectural-elements.html">Store health and safety common architectural elements</a>.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As mentioned in our introduction, Quarkus has been the focused on many content released in the last weeks. On top of that, as you’ll see in the releases section of this editorial, the project has released not one, but two versions, including an alpha of the upcoming Quarkus 2.0.</p>
<p>Let’s first take a look at the content relating to Quarkus as a development platform. If you are still new to Quarkus, you may want to start then with this post about <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/04/07/deploy-quarkus-everywhere-with-red-hat-enterprise-linux-rhel/">deploying Quarkus everywhere with RHEL</a>. After that, still on the topic of packaging and deployment, you can learn how to <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/04/08/build-even-faster-quarkus-applications-with-fast-jar/">build even faster Quarkus applications with Fast jar</a>.</p>
<p>If you are already onboard Quarkus and his very neat development model, you’ll be quite happy to learn that <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/04/14/mandrel-a-specialized-distribution-of-graalvm-for-quarkus/">Mandrel, a specialized distribution of GraalVM for Quarkus</a> is coming up!</p>
<p>As you may be aware, Quarkus comes already with quite a few supported extensions, but you may still want to learn more about <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/solving-problems-with-custom-extensions/">custom extensions and which problems they can help you solve</a>.</p>
<p>If you are already running or developing a few webapps on Quarkus, you’ll be interested in <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/gui-react-patternfly/">learning how to add eye candy to it</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_from_the_community">From the community</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Let’s take a look at what’s been happening in the community since our last editorial.</p>
<p>First up is a post by Hao Wu, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/04/how-to-interact-with-business-processes-using-camel-routes.html">How to Interact with Business Processes Using Camel Routes</a>, that neatly explains using Apache Camel to interact with business processes deployed in a KIE server.</p>
<p>Rebecca Searls, over at the RESTEasy blog, recently added a post titled <a href="https://resteasy.github.io/2021/04/05/blog-ParamConverter-with-Quarkus/">JAX-RS ParamConverter with Quarkus</a> that shows how to write RESTful services with Quarkus using the JAX-RS ParamConverter.</p>
<p>Eric Schabell has, yet again, delivered some great posts recently that demonstrate how community technology can solve real world business problems.</p>
<p>Finishing off a series of articles on point of sale architectures, Eric delves in a specific example in his post, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/point-of-sale-example-image-distribution-architecture.html">Point of sale - Example image distribution architecture</a>.
Be sure to check the links at the end of the post in case you missed any of the other articles in his architecture blueprint for point of sale imaging in retail.</p>
<p>Not one to rest, Eric kicks things off with another series to share an architectural blueprint for the use case of deploying a container-based eCommerce website while moving away from tightly coupled existing eCommerce platform.</p>
<p>This first article in this series is <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/headless-ecommerce-an-architectural-introduction.html">Headless eCommerce - An architectural introduction</a>, which gives you an outline for the use case.</p>
<p>Eric then continues the series with his post, <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/04/headless-ecommerce-common-architectural-elements.html">Headless eCommerce - Common architectural elements</a>.
In this article, Eric goes into detail on common generic elements that make up the architecture blueprint for the headless eCommerce use case.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the rest of Eric’s series!
I’m sure there’s lots more great information on the way.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 25 March 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial where we search through the JBoss Community for interesting articles and updates</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_introducing_the_prolific_eric_schabell">Introducing the prolific Eric Schabell</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If you are a regular reader of the JBoss Editorial  you will be very familiar with the work of Eric Schabell, arguably one of the most prolific writers within the JBoss Community.  This edition is no different and sees Eric product three more articles.</p>
<p>Eric’s first article is a continuation of his Supply Chain Integration Blueprint discussion.  In this article Eric <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/supply-chain-integration-example-store-integration-architecture.html">expands on the common architectural elements discussed previously and outlines an example Store integration architecture for Supply Chain integration</a>.</p>
<p>Eric’s second article walks us through <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/codeready-containers-howto-setup-openshift-47-on-local-machine.html">the necessary steps for installing and running the OpenShift Container Platform 4.7 on our local machines</a>.</p>
<p>Eric’s final article kicks off a new series of articles within which he will introduce a new architectural blueprint covering <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/point-of-sale-an-architectural-introduction.html">"Simplifying and modernizing central management of distributed point-of-sale devices with built in support for container based applications"</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_whats_new_in_kogito_land">What’s new in Kogito land?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>The <a href="http://kie.org">Kogito team</a> have been busy over the last few weeks publishing a number of interesting blog posts covering different aspects of the Kogito ecosystem.</p>
<p>We begin our coverage with an article written by William <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/building-prometheus-dashboards-in-business-central.html">demonstrating how to integrate metrics from a Prometheus datasource into the Business Central</a>.  The article walks you through the process from the creation of the data set within Dashbuilder, building the dashboard, how to consider filtering requirements and how to test the dashboard.</p>
<p>The next article, written by Manaswini, follows on from William’s article and <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/time-series-component-for-dashbuilder.html">demonstrates how you can further extend your dashboard through the integration and visualisation of time series data</a>.</p>
<p>The final article, written by Ricardo, introduces us to Kogito’s support for the <a href="https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/">CNCF Serverless Workflow</a> specification, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/restful-services-orchestration-with-kogito-and-openapi.html">allowing Kogito to provide a serverless interface to a service which can also be used to orchestrate RESTful services described through the OpenAPI standard</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_clustering_wildfly_using_dns_ping">Clustering WildFly using DNS ping</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>When running within a kubernetes environment it is natural to consider the <a href="http://www.jgroups.org/manual5/index.html#_kube_ping">KUBE_PING protocol</a> for cluster discovery, a protocol relying on the ability to query the kubernetes API server.  If you want to remain agnostic of your environment, or if you do not have sufficient permissions to query the kubernetes API server, then an alternative approach to consider would be the <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/03/12/Bootable-jar-jkube-clustering-dns-ping-openshift/">DNS_PING protocol</a> as <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/03/12/Bootable-jar-jkube-clustering-dns-ping-openshift/">demonstrated by Yeray using a simple WildFly bootable JAR application</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_optimizing_camel_3_9_no_more_saw_tooth_jvm_garbage_collection">Optimizing Camel 3.9, no more saw tooth JVM garbage collection</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>The upcoming Camel 3.9 release will include some additional, significant improvements in the performance of the internal routing engine leading to a dramatic reduction in object allocation during continuous use.  The Camel team focussed on the five major areas of the codebase they had identified during performance testing with the intention of reducing the allocation count as much as possible, they managed to go one better and achieved a sustained object allocation count of zero!  For more information take a look at <a href="http://www.davsclaus.com/2021/03/apache-camel-39-no-more-saw-tooth-jvm.html">Claus' blog describing the effort</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_monitoring_quarkus_applications_on_openshift">Monitoring Quarkus applications on OpenShift</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If you are running a Quarkus application on OpenShift you will most likely have a need for integrating with the centralised prometheus instance within the cluster.  This integration is fairly straight forward and can be achieved after following only a few simple steps <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/micrometer-prometheus-openshift/">as ably demonstrated by Jose</a>.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<p>There’s been a lot of activity since the last editorial so let’s take a look.</p>
<p>First up is Ramon Gordillo’s rather interesting take on moving legacy technology on Kubernetes.
Ramon starts by pointing out that even software that is considered "legacy" and traditionally on-prem is often packed with new and useful features.
Add to that the fact that many containerized applications still rely on legacy systems - "not all apps are greenfield" - and he builds a solid case for doing something that might otherwise induce a few gasps.
Go see how Ramon tackles running IBM DB2 in containers, <a href="https://blog.ramon-gordillo.dev/2021/03/trying-db2-in-kubernetes-for-developers/">Trying DB2 in Kubernetes for developers</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/02/migrating-jbpm-images-secured-by-ldap-to-elytron.html">Migrating jBPM images secured by LDAP to Elytron</a> by Gonzalo Muñoz Fernández is one that I thoroughly enjoyed.
If you’re not familiar with Elytron it is, as Gonzalo explains, Wildfly’s security framework that puts security management and application access into a single subsystem.
In his post, Gonzalo clearly describes and then steps through how to migrate jBPM images from PicketBox, which is a security subsystem based on JAAS login modules, over to Elytron.</p>
<p>Also on the Kogito blog, Paul Brown and Emily Murphy take on the challenge of <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/optimizing-covid-19-vaccination-appointment-scheduling.html">Optimizing COVID-19 vaccination appointment scheduling</a>.
Their post details the approach for using OptaPlanner to handle planning constraints and automatically assign vaccination appointments.
Getting vaccinations rolled out globally is a massive logistical and planning challenge so it’s comforting to know our community is providing tooling to get us all back to "normal".</p>
<p>The Red Hat Developer blog has a couple of recent entries focused on JavaScript that are both good reads.</p>
<p>Michael Dawson introduces us to the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/03/08/introduction-to-the-node-js-reference-architecture-part-1-overview/">Node.js reference architecture from Red Hat and IBM</a> and explains their reasons for creating it.
The goal is to help developers make good choices when navigating the vibrant and extensive JavaScript ecosystem by recommending packages based on shared experience across teams and projects.</p>
<p>Joel Lord takes us through <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/03/04/building-rootless-containers-for-javascript-front-ends/">Building rootless containers for JavaScript front ends</a> to demonstrate how you can avoid security vulnerabilities and potential disaster.</p>

<p>Our ever productive Eric Schabell has brought us some fantastic content that should really get you thinking about community technology can apply to solve real world business problems.</p>

How quickly times flies!
In this edition, expect to find release information, blog posts, and general updates from around the JBoss Community.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_releases">Releases!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-11-2-final-released/">Quarkus 1.11.2.Final</a> is the second maintenance release for the Quarkus 1.11 branch. The notable bug fix with this version is updating to Hibernate ORM 5.4.27.SP1 which fixes a potential data loss issue. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/releases/tag/1.11.2.Final">full changelog for more info</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-11-3-final-released/">Quarkus 1.11.3.Final</a> is a quick bug fix release that focused on a regression making it impossible to build native executables if your project was using both RESTEasy and OpenTracing. <a href="https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/releases/tag/1.11.3.Final">Please see the full changelog</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/02/11/WildFly2201-Released/">Wildfly 22.0.1</a> has been released, about a month after 22.0.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/02/kogito-tooling-0-8-3-released.html">Kogito Tooling 0.8.3 released</a> a few days ago.

<h2 id="_highlights_from_the_blogosphere">Highlights from the blogosphere</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Eric Schabell published a migration guide for a traditional JBoss BPM application running either within a VM or on bare-metal to running inside containers using OpenShift Container Platform.
In <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/4-easy-steps-for-migrating-projects-to-openshift-container-platform.html">his post he breaks the migration down into four steps</a>.
I won’t detail them all here, but the steps are very easy and you should be able to get up and running quickly on your own laptop, even without having some of the tech installed previously!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/02/improvements-of-project-authoring-in-business-central.html">Abhishek Kumar discussed project authoring improvements within Business Central recently on the KIE Blog</a>.
The features he discusses are:
. Opening projects directly with a URL
. Changing the default asset page size
. Security permissions for project screen tools and tabs</p>
<p>Each of these help users in the authoring process within Business Central through either ease of use or security!</p>
<p>Still on the KIE Blog, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/01/how-to-use-a-pmml-file-in-dmn-editor-vscode.html">Yeser Amer demonstrates how to use PMML models in the DMN Editor</a>.
PMML support was released with version 0.7.0.
PMML is an XML file describing a predictive model often generated by data mining or AI algorithms.
The support for this format within the VSCode plugin was recently released and follows the same usage patterns as those found within Business Central, so it may very well be familiar to some.</p>
<p>A number of blogs about Quarkus sprang up over the past couple of weeks!</p>
<p>Firstly, Georgios Andrianakis discusses <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/resteasy-reactive-faq/">achieving massive performance without headaches</a> in a RESTEasy application on Quarkus using RESTEasy Reactive.
He talks about the different models, how to use them, the best way to get performance out of each model, and why this will likely becoming the default model within RESTEasy on Quarkus in the near future.</p>
<p>Clement Escoffier <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/getting-started-amqp/">helps us get started with AMQP in Quarkus</a> with an in-depth demo similar to using Kafka.
He walks you through the basics and gives you a running project which he steps through to show you all the basics.</p>
<p>Over on the Red Hat Developers Blog, Eric Deandrea shows us a very cool trick, or maybe the power of Quarkus’s Spring compatibility, about running a Spring Boot application on Quarkus without changing a single line of Java code!
It is definitely worth the read, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/02/09/spring-boot-on-quarkus-magic-or-madness/">head on over to check it out</a>!</p>
<p>If you missed the announcement about Quarkus remote development, be sure to read up about it by Daniel Oh <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/02/11/enhancing-the-development-loop-with-quarkus-remote-development/">on the Red Hat Developer Blog</a>.
Using a mutable-jar package, you can deploy onto OpenShift and continue to develop remotely without having to build a new container and push every time you want to see a change!
What an amazing way to build on the cloud and make sure everything works correctly without having slow downs!</p>
<p>Yeray Borges of the Wildfly team <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/02/01/Bootable-jar-jkube-clustering-openshift/">demonstrates how to deploy a bootable Wildfly application jar which caches the HTTP session state</a>.
It’s a useful option allowing you to build and test locally and then push to OpenShift with minimal changes ensuring your application still works in the cloud.</p>
<p>Lastly, Mario Fusco and Edson Yanaga have a presentation from a recent DevNation Live about designing a Java API.
Check it out over on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/devnation/tech-talks/design-java-apis">the Red Hat Developer blog</a>.
Certainly worth the watch if you develop APIs in Java (which should be most of you).</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 28 January 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Hello! Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial that brings you news and updates from our community.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_releases">Releases!!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Infinispan 12 release, codenamed <code>Lockdown</code>, brings a ton of new features and improvements.
Indexing and querying capabilities have seen a number of improvements with the help of Hibernate Search integration.
ProtoStream marshalling is upgraded with a new <code>@ProtoAdapter</code> annotation that lets you easily integrate third-party classes.
It’s a pretty elegant solution to what could present itself as a real headache for developers.
Speaking of marshalling improvements, Infinispan 12 also makes your life easier by automatically generating and registering <code>SerializationContextInitializer</code> implementations to marshall user types.
Also notable is the SPI for cross-site replication merge conflicts, which continues on the brilliant work that team has done to provide a solution for ensuring data integrity.
There’s a lot going on in Infinispan 12 and probably too much to try and sum up here so why not head over and read all the details in the <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2021/01/25/infinispan-12-final">Infinispan 12.0.0.Final Announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the entire Infinispan team on all the hard work.</p>
<p><a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-11-0-final-released/">Quarkus 1.11</a> is here!
This release brings you RESTEasy Reactive, which is a new JAX-RS implementation for writing RESTful services.
Quarkus 1.11 also introduces the Dev UI so you can quickly visualize all your loaded extensions, access docs, and more.
Of course there are other things in Quarkus 1.11 but RESTEasy Reactive and the Dev UI look to be quite promising indeed.</p>
<p>The Quarkus team keep things rolling with the release of <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/intellij-quarkus-tools-1.3.0/">Quarkus Tools for IntelliJ 1.3.0</a> that adds codestarts to the Quarkus project wizard.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.keycloak.org//2021/01/keycloak-1202-released.html">Keycloak 12.0.2</a> is now available too!

      <h1>This Week in JBoss: 14 January 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to the first installment of our JBoss Editorial for 2021! And to start the year, we have a brand new major release of the core product of the JBoss community! Yes, Wildfly 22 is out!</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_wildfly_22_and_camel_3_7">Wildfly 22 and Camel 3.7</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Yes! We have a brand new major version of Wildfly! <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/01/13/WildFly22-Final-Released/">Wildfly 22 is out!</a>.</p>
<p>This release includes support for use of log4j2 in applications, new base health and metrics subsystems to provide server observability for users who don’t need the application instrumentation that comes with MicroProfile Health and Metrics, and a number of other features related to management, provisioning, messaging and security. Plus numerous bug fixes, enhancements and component upgrades.</p>
<p>On top of that, there is also an updated version of the new tech-preview WildFly Preview distribution. This will allow the community have a look at what Wildfly developers are doing for Jakarta EE 9 support, along with other changes in the server architecture that are expected to appear later in 2021.</p>
<p>Wildfly 22 is already a nice treat, but we also have <a href="https://camel.apache.org/blog/2020/12/Camel37-Whatsnew/">Camel 3.7</a>, which also quite exciting, and fortunately for all of us, Claus Ibsen has published a review of what he called <a href="http://www.davsclaus.com/2020/12/apache-camel-37-lts-released-fastest.html">the fastest Camel ever!</a> So, go check it out if you want to know more about this camel release.</p>

<p>A few interesting technical articles came out in the last weeks, so we’ll try to catch you up with three of them here. First, we have an excellent one from Bela Ban on <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/12/running-jgroups-raft-as-service.html">running JGroups raft as a service</a>. It’s very hands on post, focusing on getting everything running. Then we have a longer walkthrough to let you experiment on <a href="https://blog.ramon-gordillo.dev/2020/12/spring-boot-embedded-cache-with-infinispan-in-kubernetes/">using Spring boot embedded cache with Infinispan on Kubernetes</a>. Certainly, worth a look, isn’t it? The last one is, of course, on Quarkus, because Quarkus is, as it should, all the rage lately. In this article, Clément Escoffier took the time to explain some of the <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/magic-control">magic beneath Quarkus and Vert.x</a> and why this is the kind magic you to have as a developer.</p>

<p>As always, our very own Eric Schabell has been busy in the few last weeks and released a steady stream of new content. First, he published <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/01/codeready-containers-installing.html">part4 - Installing business automation operator</a> of his series on CodeReady containers. He then revisited the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/12/codeready-containers-exploring-home-loan-mortgage-process.html">Home loan mortgage process using CodeReady Containers</a>.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <article class="" data-tags="Christmas, 2020">
      <h1>This Week in JBoss: 25 December 2020</h1>
      <p>I’m writing this on Christmas Day and have spent the last week or so thinking about what I should put
into my traditional 25th of December entry. Then it came to me in that "lightbulb moment": I’d replicate,
more or less, what I said to my entire team/org before I went on vacation a few days earlier. It’s a summary
of the year and I think it’s relevant for our wider community too. So here it is in a slightly modified form …​</p>
<p>I wanted to spend a few minutes thanking you all for the work and interactions you’ve done over this testing year!
I don’t think anyone could have predicted 2020 at the start of the year and I think it’s fair to say that every one of us
has been affected in one way or another. Yet if you look back on the year and the accomplishments we’ve achieved
as a community, you could be forgiven for thinking this was a normal year!</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Making Quarkus available to all OpenShift customers, which we announced at KubeCon, as well as continuing the innovation within
(e.g., Hibernate Reactive, RESTeasy Reactive);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knative/Serverless, where we now have 7 Working Group leads out of 15 in the Knative community, we also added Functions to OpenShift Serverless;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More and more of our technologies become available to Kube developers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We continued our close involvement with AdoptOpenJDK (aka Eclipse Adoptium), helping to push it to even greater heights;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So many great innovations continued around efforts such as Kogito, Strimzi, Camel-K, Eclipse Vert.x, Infinispan, …​</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We all managed to host, attend, present at countless virtual conferences, workshops and Red Hat Summit; probably enough to realise what
we’re all missing from the real things!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eclipse MicroProfile 4.0 and Eclipse Jakarta EE 9.0 both come to life;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The list could go on and on (e.g., EAP XD, OptaPlanner, …) but my point isn’t so much to call out the successes that this
community have helped to drive but rather to illustrate that we were able to do these and more at all! In the
climate of 2020, retaining the kind of focus we have and continuing to go above and beyond, as many of you and the teams
have, is a testament to Red Hat and our communities, our culture and the supporting bonds you’ve all built up and nurtured. For that
alone I thank you and you should all be incredibly proud!</p>
<p>With that in mind, whether or not you celebrate Christmas or intend to take extended time away, make sure you do take time
to rest and recharge. Be with your friends and family as much as you can given the continuing Covid situation. Find time to unwind
but also congratulate yourself on coming together in 2020 and delivering so much to our communities, partners and customers. I’m not
even going to try to predict what 2021 will be like but if we can replicate what we’ve been able to do in 2020, I’m sure
we’ll all come through it stronger and together!</p>

    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial and last before the holidays! As always during this period of the year, we all rush to finish our ongoing tasks so that we can enjoy a bit of rest. And the projects of the JBoss community do the same, which means we have quite of lot to discuss today! So, without any further ado…​</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_quarkus_and_resteasy_reactive">Quarkus and RestEasy Reactive</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>The last months have certainly been quite active for Quarkus. Now part of the portfolio of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-quarkus">Red Hat products</a>, the project has everything but slow down. Just last week a new release, <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-10-3-final-released/">Quarkus 1.10.3</a> was published, but also RestEasy announced a large refactoring of its project <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/resteasy-reactive/">RestEasy Reactive</a> in order to integrate and support Quarkus even more. Alessio Soldano, one of the main developers of RestEasy, also shares his thoughts behind this project <a href="https://resteasy.github.io/2020/12/07/resteasy-reactive/">here</a>.</p>
<p>But that’s not all in the Quarkiverse! Andy Damevin released an interesting article on link:But that’s not all in the Quarkus-verse! Andy Damevin released an interesting article on new ways to discover Quarkus <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/extension-codestarts-a-new-way-to-learn-and-discover-quarkus/"> new ways to discover Quarkus using Extension codestarts</a>. Whether that you already know Quarkus or want to explore it for the first time, this one will be in any case quite interesting to you! Oh, and by the way Quarkiverse is by no means a "bon mot,” it’s the real thing: <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkiverse/">Quarkiverse Hub - Home of Community Extensions</a>, so go check out this article from George Gastaldi to know more about it!</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not the least, another article will help you <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/12/08/spring-boot-to-quarkus-migrations-and-more-in-red-hats-migration-toolkit-for-applications-5-1-0/">migrating your Spring Boot app to Quarkus using the Red Hat migration toolkit</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_apache_avro_and_apicurio_registry">Apache Avro and Apicurio Registry</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Avro and Apicurio got a lot of attention in the last weeks. First, Clément Escoffier, who already took the time to blog about <a href="">How to Use Kafka, Schema Registry and Avro with Quarkus</a> a few months ago, just released a new article on <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/avro-native/">Using Avro in a native executable</a>. Hugo Guerrero also took a stab at the topic in his blog entry on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/12/11/debezium-serialization-with-apache-avro-and-apicurio-registry/">Debezium serialization with Apache Avro and Apicurio Registry</a>.</p>

      <h1>This week in JBoss - 20th November 2020</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p><em>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial! Today, we’ll focus on some core project of our community. The first one is obviously Wildfly, our Jakarta EE application server whom predecessor (JBoss AS) was the beginning of everything. The second one is our more recent and shiny project, Quarkus. Without any further ado, let’s begin!</em></p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_wildfly_a_first_taste_of_jakarta_9">Wildfly, a first Taste of Jakarta 9</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>With the release of the <a href="https://wildfly.org//news/2020/11/19/WildFly2101-Released/">Wildfly 21.01</a>, it’s time to put the Jakarta EE server back in the spotlight. Especially as this release gives a <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2020/11/12/Jakarta-EE-9-with-WildFly-Preview/">a preview of Jakarta EE 9</a>! And if your knowledge of the EE standards needs a refresher to fully enjoy this preview, we got you covered with this in depth two-part series on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/15/jakarta-ee-multitenancy-with-jpa-on-wildfly-part-1/">Jakarta EE multitenancy (part1)</a> and <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/12/jakarta-ee-multitenancy-with-jpa-on-wildfly-part-2/">(part 2)</a>.</p>
<p>But Jakarta EE 9 is not the only newsworthy item around Wildfly. The first part of my own series on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/06/wildfly-server-configuration-with-ansible-collection-for-jcliff-part-1/">automation of Wildfly using Ansible and JCliff</a> is out! It’s hand on a tutorial on how to set up Ansible and its decided collection for Wildfly (<a href="https://github.com/wildfly-extras/ansible_collections_jcliff">JCliff</a>) in order to fully automate the app server set up and configuration.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_quarkus_leading_the_future_of_java">Quarkus, Leading the Future of Java</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>It might a bold statement, but we’ve made it! Or rather Red Hat made it as Quarkus 1.7 is available as a product for a little while now. Maybe it’s time to finally take a look at it by following this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/10/leading-the-future-of-java-with-the-red-hat-build-of-quarkus-1-7/">Red Hat Quarkus tutorial</a>?</p>
<p>This is also a perfect opportunity to explore Quarkus functionality and ecosystems. For instance, take a look at this interesting post on <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/mutiny-invoke-and-call/">mutiny invoke and call</a>. Or simply explore the cloud readiness of the framework with this article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/13/how-i-built-a-serverless-blog-search-with-java-quarkus-and-aws-lambda/">building a serverless blog search with Quarkus and AWS lambda</a> and this <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-quarkus-red-hat-openshift?sc_cid=701f2000000tyBjAAI">introduction to Quarkus on Red Hat Openshift</a>?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_techbytes">Techbytes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If Quarkus and Wildfly did not quench your thirst for knowledge, let us give you a bit more nuggets. First, why not explore the topic of <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/09/openid-connect-integration-with-red-hat-3scale-api-management-and-okta/">using OpenID connect integration with 3scale</a>? Or maybe <a href="http://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2020/11/contract-first-development-event-driven.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FhFXzh+%28Christina+%E7%9A%84+J%E8%80%81%E9%97%86%29">contract first development using an event-driven approach with Kafka, AMQ Streams, APIcurio</a>? And to make it extra spicy, Christina has even a added a touch of Google protobuf! By the way, if "event driven" is your thing, you can then move this other article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/17/event-driven-serverless-applications-with-camel-k/">event driven serverless with Camel K</a>.</p>
<p>Still hungry for more? Well, maybe it’s time for less crunchy and technical details? What about stepping back and invite some reflection on <a href="http://www.ofbizian.com/2020/11/open-source-monetization-ecosystem.html">Open Source monetization ecosystem</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_releases_releases_releases">Releases, releases, releases…​</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>In case you somehow missed above (most likely by jumping directly to this section) …​ <a href="https://wildfly.org//news/2020/11/19/WildFly2101-Released/">Wildlfy 21 Alpha 1 has been released</a>!</p>

<h2 id="_decaf">Decaf</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>All this Java made you too jittery? Time for a Java break? Here are a few dry cookies to go along your cup of joe. As mentioned above, the first part of my series on using [Ansible to automate Wildfly setup] might a nice palate cleanser. Also, if you are using Docker you might be interested in this article describing how to <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/19/transitioning-from-docker-to-podman/">transitioning from Docker to Podman</a>.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 30 September 2020</h1>
      <p>It’s that time again where we round up the latest news from the community…</p>
<p>Are you looking to develop projects on your local machine, and push them on to a real OpenShift Container Platform, without having to worry about cloud hosting of your container platform?
In this <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/how-to-setup-openshift-container-platform-45.html">post</a> Eric Schabell provides an easy way to get up and running with CodeReady containers on your own development machine.
He’s automated most of the process through scripts, and guides you through the rest of the process.
Eric also shows you how to drop into the Developer console in OCP providing a developer focused view that hides much of the plumbing that is not needed during development.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/28/call-an-existing-rest-service-with-apache-camel-k/">post</a> Mary Cochran shows us a simple way to connect existing services together using CamelK via each service’s REST APIs.
Mary gets deep into the details providing code examples and commands to get you up and running.</p>
<p>Eric Schabell continues his <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/financial-payments-architecture-an-introduction.html">blog series</a>, bringing you architectural blueprints for&nbsp;cloud-native financial payment services.
The blueprints are focused on proven interactions, messaging, processing, and integration patterns that you can put to use when building a cloud-native payment architecture.
This week he covers the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/payments-architecture-common-elements.html">Common Architecture Elements</a> that make up the architecture, and gets into some details with the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/payments-architecture-immediate-payments-example.html">Immediate Payments Example</a>.</p>
<p>As is normal for this time of year, the conference season is beginning to kick off.
Albeit this year in a virtual arena.
Undoubtedly this is an unfortunate situation for those that enjoy the in-person events.
However, it’s great for accessibility and reach allowing many more people across to globe to attend.
DevConf.US 2020 is one such event.
It’s a free, Red Hat sponsored technology conference for community project and professional contributors to Free and Open Source technologies.
Read more <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/devconfus-2020-appdev-containerization-ask-the-experts.html">here</a> where Eric describes the “AppDev &amp; Containerization Ask the Experts” Panels that he and Kurt Stam  will be moderating.</p>
<p>This week Kapil Shukla explains how to <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/28/build-a-data-streaming-pipeline-using-kafka-streams-and-quarkus/">build a data streaming pipeline using Kafka Streams and Quarkus</a>.
In this post Kapil shows how data can be processed in real-time as and when it arrives, instead of being batch processed as was needed in the past.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/22/troubleshooting-user-task-errors-in-red-hat-process-automation-manager-and-red-hat-jboss-bpm-suite/">Post</a> Anton Giertli provides help with troubleshooting user task errors in Red Hat Process Automation Manager and Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite.
If you are a developer working with user tasks and having trouble debugging them, this post might well help you out.</p>
<p>With the recent release of Apache Camel VS Code extension (0.0.27) comes several new language support features for Apache Camel.
Read this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/18/new-language-support-features-in-apache-camel-vs-code-extension-0-0-27/">post</a> to learn more.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 16 September 2020</h1>
      <p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial where we gather news from our communities and explore developments from our projects.</p>
<p>Our very own Mark Little goes into detail to explain Quarkus and Jakarta EE compatibility. Mark gives an insightful breakdown of the history for both projects and answers a much asked question, will Quarkus and Jarkata EE come together? No spoilers here, though. Go read Mark’s <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/11/quarkus-and-jakarta-ee-together-or-not/">Quarkus and Jakarta EE: Together, or not?</a> if you already haven’t.</p>
<p>In the evangelist’s corner, Eric Schabell has brought out an excellent <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/beginners-guide-to-decision-management-retail-web-shop.html">hands-on workshop with labs</a> for Red Hat Decision Manager that show you how to design and build a retail web shop from scratch.</p>
<p>Eric also teams up with Ramon Villarreal to bring you architectural blueprints for <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/financial-payments-architecture-an-introduction.html">cloud-native financial payment services</a>. The blueprints are focused on proven interactions, messaging, processing, and integration patterns that you can put to use when building a cloud-native payment architecture.</p>
<p>Leon Matthews continues the topic of all things financial with his analysis of the history of Java in the banking sector and the role Quarkus is playing in allowing banks and financial institutions to embrace change, innovate to remain competitive, and become more efficient. Read Leon’s post: <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/25-years-and-going-strong-why-java-matters-future-banks?source=bloglisting">25 years and going strong: Why Java matters to the future of banks</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of Quarkus, Clement Escoffier shows you how to build a stream of beer and then retrieve beers in a reactive way. After walking you through how you can do that with Mutiny, Clement provides a gist with all the code that you can compile and execute with jbang and a single command. You can find everything in his <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/mutiny-pagination/">Handling paginated APIs with Mutiny</a> post.</p>
<p>Another post from the Quarkus team that is worth reading is Jeff Beck’s <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/wipro-customer-story/">Wipro Addresses Seismic Shift in Retail with Quarkus</a>. Jeff shares the Wipro story by describing their needs and challenges and how they adopted Quarkus to modernize their applications and address customer use cases.</p>
<p>If it hasn’t crossed your radar, Bela Ban shows us his plans for a <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/09/one-size-fits-all-jgroups.html">One Size Fits All JGroups</a> program and explains what is needed to get there.</p>
<p>Jakub Scholz on the Strimzi team shares a post that looks at using the <a href="https://strimzi.io/blog/2020/09/01/enforce-custom-resource-policies-with-opa-gatekeeper/">Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper project to enforce policies when creating custom resources</a> and demonstrates how this is useful. While the post focuses on Strimzi, Jakub points out how Gatekeeper can be used with other projects so go take a look.</p>
<p>Releases!!</p>
<p>Congratulations to the Infinispan team for releasing the Dev03 cut of Infinispan 12. Cross-site replication capabilities continue to advance with an SPI that includes configurable policies for merging conflicting values from asynchronous backups, a feature which guarantees data consistency between global Infinispan clusters. That’s no small feat of engineering! Find out about that and more over on the <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/09/08/infinispan-12/">Infinispan blog</a>.</p>
<p>Quarkus 1.8 is out with some shiny new features, including jbang integration for easy Quarkus-based scripting, support for multiple persistence units for the Hibernate ORM extension, a new Micrometer extension, and update to GraalVM 20.2 for building native apps from Quarkus projects. Here is the <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-8-0-final-released/">announcement with all the info</a>.</p>
<p>Keycloak have announced their new Account Console, built on React and PatternFly 4. The latest version offers a fresher look and feel with custom themes and extensions. Go <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2020/09/new-account-console.adoc">check it out</a>.</p>

      <h1>JBoss Weekly Editorial 27 August 2020</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Weekly Editorial!
Summer is drawing to a close, but that doesn’t mean Red Hat has been resting, or that nothing has been happening over the past two weeks.
There’s been some great movement and progress made, which we’ll cover.
In this edition we’re going to focus on OpenShift, the blogosphere, and finally, other project news.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_openshift">OpenShift</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Last week was KubeCon Europe 2020, which as you can guess, was a big event for OpenShift!
We had 15 speakers from Red Hat speaking over the three days, giving 17 talks.
A number of new announcements, blog posts, and articles came out during KubeCon Europe 2020, They’re all liked at <a href="https://www.openshift.com/kubecon">the OpenShift event page</a>.
There’s simply too many to link here.
The above event page has videos, press release links, links to other announcements and blogs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_blogs">Blogs</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Continuing the trend about OpenShift, Paul Vergilis wrote about external clients and Red Hat AMQ over at the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/26/connecting-external-clients-to-red-hat-amq-broker-on-red-hat-openshift/">Red Hat Developer blog</a>.
If you’re interested in getting started with Strimzi, Apache Kafka on Kubernetes, you’ll want to catch up on the blog post Paolo Patierno and Jakub Scholz wrote: <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/14/introduction-to-strimzi-apache-kafka-on-kubernetes-kubecon-europe-2020/">Introduction to Strimzi: Apache Kafka on Kubernetes (KubeCon Europe 2020)</a>.
For those of you running OpenJDK 8, you’ll want to know more about JDK Flight Recorder available in OpenJDK 8u262. An indepth intro is available at the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/25/get-started-with-jdk-flight-recorder-in-openjdk-8u/">Red Hat Developer Blog</a> written by Mario Torre.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_projects">Projects</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>To wrap up this edition, we will be looking at two announcements from Keycloak:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.keycloak.org//2020/08/keycloak-1101-released.html">Keycloak 11.0.1 released</a> - fixing seven bugs</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_jgroups_5">JGroups 5!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Exciting news from Bela Ban as <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/08/jgroups-500final-released.html">JGroups 5.0.0.Final</a> is released. JGroups 5 brings lots of improvements and some major API changes.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest change is that <a href="http://www.jgroups.org/manual5/index.html#Message"><code>Message</code></a> is now an interface with a number of subclasses that perform late marshalling so object payload is serialized at the point when messages are sent, which eliminates a memory allocation and makes JGroups performance even better.</p>
<p>Other cool features in JGroups 5 are <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/07/double-your-performance-virtual-threads.html">virtual thread support</a>, an implementation of the Random Early Drop (RED) protocol, more efficient FD_ALL3 failure detection, a new protocol to dump stats, and lots more.</p>
<p>Hearty congratulations to Bela and all the contributors and folks who made it happen!!</p>

<p>As Quarkus community is increasing the question of how to migrate to this new framework (or rather runtime) often arises. If you happen to have such predicament with Spring Boot, I’m sure you’ll be quite interested to read this article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/17/migrating-spring-boot-tests-to-quarkus/">migrating Spring Boot tests to Quarkus</a>.</p>

<p>Quite a lot of exciting things are happening in the realm of JGroups lately! Last time, we already mentioned the <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/06/new-netty-transport.html">new netty transport</a>, but Bela Ban, the creator of project, got us even more excited with this news about <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/07/double-your-performance-virtual-threads.html">how one can double its performance using virtual threads (fibers) on JDK15/16</a>!!!

<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As said above, the last two weeks have been particularly rich in interesting content around the JBoss community and the Java ecosystem at large. Some of those articles took the time to go back and rethink some aspects of our work that we take for granted. Let’s first mention this original take on java programming that focuses on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/09/behavior-is-easy-state-is-hard-tame-inconsistent-state-in-your-java-code/">taming inconsistent state in a Java code</a>.</p>
<p>This first article is already pretty centered around coding, but this next one goes into the very guts of Infinispan! If you know the project, I’m sure you’ll find this entry on <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/07/22/anchored-keys/">anchored keys</a> as fascinating as I did!</p>
<p>Let’s also revisit a classic: load balancing a JEE app server (such as Wildfly or its product counterpart JBoss EAP), but with a twist: <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/15/load-balancing-red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-subclusters-with-mod_cluster/">Load balancing Red Hat JBoss EAP with subclusters</a>.</p>

<p>No rest for the wicked! And no, no rest for our very own Eric D. Schabell! In the last two weeks, he has been quite busy again.

With the host, he discussed the best practices for Agile integration. If you are interested in this topic, fetch the episode, you won’t regret it!</p>
<p>That’s not all. Eric also took the time to update and release his "fully updated to the latest release" version of his <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/beginners-guide-building-a-retail-web-shop-workshop-update.html">Beginners guide - Building a retail web shop workshop update</a>.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 9 July 2020: Over the (j)cliff!</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial! Summer has begun, well, at least for those of you readers living in the northern hemisphere :)! So let’s enjoy it by giving some nice, interesting and exciting reading material to enjoy while resting in the sun (with your mask, #staysafe!).</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_infinispan_11">Infinispan 11!</h2>

</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_ansible_collection_for_jcliff">Ansible Collection for JCliff</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>It’s a pet project of mine that I have already mentioned a few months ago: Andrew Block, Roel Holzmans and I have been working on integrating further Widlfy (and EAP) into Ansible, in order to ensure that one can use the tool to fine-tune as much as possible the JEE server’s configuration. We leverage an existing Open Source Java tool called <a href="https://github.com/bserdar/jcliff">JCliff</a> to just that.</p>
<p>Last year, we released a role, already available in <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/redhat-cop/jcliff">Ansible Galaxy</a>, to integrate JCliff into Ansible. However, since then, the Ansible community released a new format to distribute extension, called Ansible Collection. We therefore decide to migrate our content there and we finally released, just this week, a very first version: <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/redhat/jcliff">Ansible Collection for JCliff 0.0.1</a>.</p>
<p>So, please check it out! All you need to do is $ ansible-galaxy collection install redhat.jcliff:0.0.1 and, voilà, the collection is installed and you can start to <a href="https://github.com/ansible-middleware/ansible_collections_jcliff_demo">play with it</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, almost forgot! This release also supports, on tops of Linux, MacOSX with homebrew! (Windows using Chocolatey is coming next).</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss: 26 June 2020</h1>
      <p>Here we are, once again at the close of June.
Another summer has begun, albeit a little different than most.
I hope everyone is safe, healthy, and doing well.
There have been some very interesting blogs posted in the past couple of weeks that we’ll discuss in this edition, as well as a few releases.</p>
<p>Operators in Kubernetes provide an extension point for the platform.
They follow a pattern allowing you to manage resources and applications within the cluster.
An operator can be either namespace-scoped or cluster-scoped.
Did you know, however, that you can convert between the two?
That is exactly what Abhishek Koserwal details in six steps over on the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/26/migrating-a-namespace-scoped-operator-to-a-cluster-scoped-operator/">Red Hat Developer blog</a>.
Abhishek walks you through a basic example and provides the full example as a GitHub repo.
Read the article for more information, and reasons why you may want or need to switch between the different scopes.</p>
<p>Multitenancy may be something you deal with everyday, or it may be something you’re looking at adding to your current application base.
Either way, dealing with persistence can be tricky.
Tenants must not see each other’s data, but be allowed to operate simultaneously.
Your application must also perform well while still being easy to maintain.
Rhuan Rocha has started a two part series on how to use JPA with Multitenancy over on the Red Hat Developer blog.
<a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/15/jakarta-ee-multitenancy-with-jpa-on-wildfly-part-1/">The first entry</a> details the problem and presents a possible solution using WildFly and EJBs.
Expect the next installment to look more at Hibernate and JPA solutions.</p>
<p>Effortlessly building a native application is of course, one of the amazing capabilities of Quarkus.
However, when it comes to debugging, a native Quarkus application makes debugging <strong>very</strong> difficult.
A large part of this is the optimizations that happen to create that quick, small, native binary.
This debugging complication hasn’t gone unnoticed.
Andrew Dinn has been working on this problem.
He contributed a solution where the debug information is embedded with in the native image and can be access with <code>gdb</code>.
If you’d like to learn more about the solution, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/25/debugging-graalvm-native-images-using-gdb/">read Andrew’s blog entry</a>.</p>
<p>Continuing with the Quarkus theme, Durgesh Anaokar wrote about <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/19/develop-and-test-a-quarkus-client-on-red-hat-codeready-containers-with-red-hat-data-grid-8-0/">developing and testing a Quarkus Red Hat Data Grid client using Red Hat CodeReady Containers</a>.
Durgesh details installing CRC (Red Hat Code Ready Containers) and Data Grid on OpenShift 4 as well as running the client.
Naturally, his project code is hosted in GitHub, you’ll find that link in his blog entry.</p>
<p>Red Hat now has images, Universal Base Images to be exact, of OpenJDK (8 and 11) in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2.
A Universal Base Image (UBI) is an OCI-compliant container base OS image with runtime and language support that can be used as the base for Docker images and Podman/Buildah images.
These will allow you to deploy and build supportable applications on Red Hat OpenShift and RHEL.
It also includes a number of additional user-space packages over a base UBI.
Read more about this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/25/introducing-the-red-hat-build-of-the-openjdk-universal-base-images-now-in-red-hat-enterprise-linux-8-2/">over at Red Hat Developers</a>.</p>
<p>If you have been following, you’ll know the Infinispan team has been hard at work on Infinispan 11.
They are proud to announce that <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/06/15/infinispan-11/">Inifinspan 11.0.0. Final has been released</a>!
A number of improvements and features have been added to this release including clustering, CLI, Hot Rod Client improvements, non-blocking internals, and others.</p>
<p>Along with that new Infinispan release, you can now deploy a <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/06/16/native-server-announce/">natively compiled version of the Infinispan server</a>!
The memory footprint is only 286MB.
There are also native Quarkus extensions for your Quarkus based applications.</p>
<p>Not to be left out of the cloud native party, Apache Camel is <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/18/camel-k-1-0-the-serverless-integration-platform-goes-ga/">announcing the GA release of Apache Camel K 1.0</a>.
This release includes tooling, connectors, and integrations with Knative.
This is a great step forward for doing integrations with a small footprint.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/17/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-expansion-pack-1-0-released/">Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack 1.0</a> was recently released.
This is a patch that adds MicroProfile capabilities to JBoss EAP.
There are some policy changes you will need to be aware of, but you find links to all of thosewithin the announcement.</p>
<p>Thanks again for being with us on another JBoss Editorial!</p>

    <p class="preamble"></p><p>We’re a little light on the news this time, but those of us who have been reading the editorial for a few years will be familiar with the "after Summit slump."
With Red Hat Summit behind us (and what a great Summit, check out the sessions on demand if you missed them), many people have taken PTO.
Expect all the news, blogs, releases, etc. to pick back up in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>All that being said, we do have some blogs to go over and one release.</p><p></p>

<h2 id="_2020_04_30_the_virtual_red_hat_summit_week">[2020-04-30] - The Virtual Red Hat Summit week</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>I’m writing this as we wrap up another successful Red Hat Summit.
But this year, with a significant distinction: the event was 100%
virtual. Despite the involuntary move to virtual, there were many
benefits that came about from the change in format. The event was
completely free, and of course required no travel, allowing a much
broader and more diverse set of attendees to benefit from the
content and experience. It was also ran in three regions to
accommodate many more timezones.</p>
<p>Being Red Hat we were keen to experiment with the format and find
new ways to engage with the community. It was important for us to
carry over as much of the personality and intimacy of the physical
event as possible. So, this needed to be more than just a bunch of
streamed talks. The talks were pre-recorded which allowed the
presenter(s) to participate directly in the Q&amp;A in real-time
as the talk proceeded. There was also a variety of sessions that
went beyond the talk format. For examples see
<em>Ask the experts</em>, <em>Networking social hour</em>, and
the <em>Virtual Open Neighborhood</em> on the
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/summit/agenda/agenda-at-a-glance">agenda</a>.</p>
<p>If you weren’t able to attend, or want to catch some of the
talks you missed, you can <a href="https://onlinexperiences.com/Launch/QReg.htm?ShowUUID=4245E6E3-7D25-496D-9B08-4CBDC87CCE74">re-live the virtual event here</a>.</p>
